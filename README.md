# flickr-url-parser

This is a library for parsing Flickr URLs.
You enter a Flickr URL, and it tells you what sort of URL it is.

Examples:

```console
$ flickr_url_parser "https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/50567413447"
{"type": "single_photo", "photo_id": "50567413447"}

$ flickr_url_parser "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aljazeeraenglish/albums/72157626164453131"
{"type": "album", "user_url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/aljazeeraenglish", "album_id": "72157626164453131"}

$ flickr_url_parser "https://www.flickr.com/people/blueminds/"
{"type": "user", "user_url": "https://www.flickr.com/photos/blueminds"}
```

This was extracted as a standalone bit of functionality from [Flinumeratr], a toy that shows you a list of photos that can be viewed at a Flickr URL.

## Usage

There are two ways to use flickr_url_parser:

1.  **As a command-line tool.**
    Run `flickr_url_parser`, passing the Flickr URL as a single argument:
    
    ```console
    $ flickr_url_parser "https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/50567413447"
    {"type": "single_photo", "photo_id": "50567413447"}
    ```
    
    The result will be printed as a JSON object.
    
    To see more information about the possible return values, run `flickr_url_parser --help`.

2.  **As a Python library.**
    Import the function `parse_flickr_url` and pass the Flickr URL as a single argument:

    ```pycon
    >>> from flickr_url_parser import parse_flickr_url

    >>> parse_flickr_url("https://www.flickr.com/photos/sdasmarchives/50567413447")
    {"type": "single_photo", "photo_id": "50567413447"}
    ```
    
    To see more information about the possible return values, use the [`help` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help):
    
    ```pycon
    >>> help(parse_flickr_url)
    ```

## Development

You can set up a local development environment by cloning the repo and installing dependencies:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Flickr-Foundation/flickr-url-parser.git
$ cd flickr-url-parser
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -e .
```

If you want to run tests, install the dev dependencies and run py.test:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
$ coverage run -m pytest tests
$ coverage report
```

To create a new version on PyPI:

1.  Update the version in `setup.py`
2.  Add release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` and push a new tag to GitHub
3.  Deploy the release using twine:

    ```console
    $ python3 setup.py sdist
    $ python3 -m twine upload dist/* --username=__token__
    ```
    
    You will need [a PyPI API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken) to publish packages.
